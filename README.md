###Recurrent Neural Networks for song lyrics prediction. Comparison of Character vs Word-level RNNs.
#### Authors: Anhad Mohananey, Yashovardhan Chaturvedi

In this project, Character-level RNNs have been compared to Word-level RNNs in terms of the task of song lyrics prediction. The Recurrent Neural Network is implemented in Python using the [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) Library.

For help in running and testing out the code, two sample lyrics corpus have been included: beatles_corpus.txt(Beatle's song lyrics) and acdc_corpus.txt(ACDC' song lyrics).
