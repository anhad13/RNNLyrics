 in the beginning
back in nineteen fifty five
man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
and all that jive
the white man had the smoltz
the black man had the blues
no one knew what they was gonna do
but tchaikovsky had the news
he said let there be sound and there was sound
let there be light and there was light
let there be drums and there was drums
let there be guitar and there was guitar
let there be rock and it came to pass
that rock 'n' roll was born
all across the land every rockin' band
was blowing up a storm
an the guitar man got famous
the businessman got rich
and in every bar there was a super star
with a seven year itch
there were fifteen million fingers
learning how to play
and you could hear the fingers picking
and this is what they had to say let there be light
sound
drums
guitar
let there be rock one night in a club called the shaking hand
there was a ninety two decibel rocking band
the music was good and the music was loud
and the singer turned and he said to the crowd let there be rock 	

 it was one of those nights
when you turned out the lights
and everything comes into view
she was taking her time
i was losing my mind
there was nothing that she wouldn't do it wasn't the first
it wasn't the last
she knew we was making love
i was so satisfied
deep down inside
like a hand in a velvet glove seems like a touch a touch too much
seems like a touch a touch too much
too much for my body too much for my brain
this damn woman's gonna drive me insane
she's got a touch a touch too much she had the face of an angel
smiling with sin
a body of venus with arms
dealing with danger
stroking my skin
let the thunder and lightening start it wasn't the first
it wasn't the last
it wasn't that she didn't care
she wanted it hard
and wanted it fast
she liked it done medium rare seems like a touch a touch too much
seems like a touch a touch too much
too much for my body too much for my brain
this damn woman's gonna drive me insane
she's had a touch a touch too much touch me seems like a touch touch too much

hiding from the rent man

sheriff knocking on my door
ain't it funny how the time flies sitting on my sailing boat
sipping off my champagne
suzy baby all at sea
say she want to come again
feeling like a paper cup
floating down a storm drain
got myself a sailing boat
but i can't afford a drop of rain [chorus] 	

 they say that you play too loud
well baby that's tough

you could set your mind at ease
my temperature's running hot
i've been waiting all night for a bite of what you got [chorus] damnation they're puttin' you down
damnation all over town
damnation cause you're way outta reach
livin' on the streets you gotta practice what you preach [chorus] damnation left a happy home
damnation to live on your own
damnation you want to live in sin
damnation it's a rock 'n' roll
damnation just a bundle of joy
damnation you're a toy for a boy
damnation you got dollars in your eye
damnation chasin' that pie in the sky
damnation rock 'n' roll
damnation

she had the sightless eyes
telling me no lies
knockin' me out with those american thighs
taking more than her share
had me fighting for air
she told me to come but i was already there
'cause the walls start shaking
the earth was quaking
my mind was aching
and we were making it and you shook me all night long
yeah you shook me all night long working double time
on the seduction line
she was one of a kind she's just mine all mine
wanted no applause
just another course
made a meal out of me and came back for more
had to cool me down
to take another round
now i'm back in the ring to take another swing
'cause the walls were shaking
the earth was quaking

big jack big jack
he said that he's the only one who got a full sack
big jack look out jack he's always at your back you never leave a dollar
racking up the balls
you like to get it on fast
back there standing tall
when he hears the siren
he's gonna put you on the racks
he's got a bad reputation climbing all over the bars
gonna press the flesh
rockin' rollin' soldier
he's the last of them all
well tell jack he's on his way [chorus] 	

 well there's a love gone down on mine
suicidal voltage line
she sends signals outta distress
she devil she evil
she got you reelin' on a rockin' machine [chorus]
with a flick of the switch
with a flick of the switch she'll blow you sky high
with a flick of the switch
with a flick of the switch she can satisfy

 same tune as "bonny" loch lomand i'll take the high road
and you'll take the low road
and i'll be in scotland afore ye
but me and my true love
will never meet again
on the bonny bonny banks of loch lomond 	

 you can dance through the night
rock n roll music itching to fight
makin' love drunk or stoned
lookin' for dollars
get broken-boned
it's a game too tough to tame
ends up the same
sweatin' out the rain i was trapped like a fly on the wall
i was caged like a zoo animal
no escape from the fate that you make
you're a snake i've had all i can take
watch out there's a fly on the wall take a chance take a bite
rock n roll devil take me tonight
like a bitch makin' heat
beatin' on my chest
lickin' at my feet
it's a game too tough to tame
ending up the same
sweatin' in the rain
so watch out there's a fly on the wall i was trapped like a fly on the wall
i was caged like a zoo animal
no escape from the fate that you make
you're a snake i've had all i can take 	

 you can dance through the night

 in the beginning
back in nineteen fifty five
man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
and all that jive
the white man had the smoltz
the black man had the blues
no one knew what they was gonna do
but tchaikovsky had the news
he said let there be sound and there was sound
let there be light and there was light
let there be drums and there was drums
let there be guitar and there was guitar
let there be rock and it came to pass
that rock 'n' roll was born
all across the land every rockin' band
was blowing up a storm
an the guitar man got famous
the businessman got rich
and in every bar there was a super star
with a seven year itch
there were fifteen million fingers
learning how to play
and you could hear the fingers picking
and this is what they had to say let there be light
sound
drums
guitar
let there be rock one night in a club called the shaking hand
there was a ninety two decibel rocking band
the music was good and the music was loud
and the singer turned and he said to the crowd let there be rock

 push your foot to the floor
don't need no more
you've been peeking all around
while they're messing about better get your name come on in
gimme that thing and feed your war war machine make a stand show your hand
call in the high command
don't think just obey
i'm like a bird of prey so better get your name come on in
gimme that thing and feed your war war machine better watch your back
and cover your tracks
kick your foot through the door
hit the deck know the score
they take you by surprise
and here's mud in your eye this will be the day they shouldn't forget
call of the wild hungry for more
and feed your war machine let's go i've seen your war war machine 	

 well i tied my baby to the railroad track
cannonball down the line
giving that woman just a one more chance
to give it to me one more time
engineer wishing he was home in bed
dreaming about casey jones
wide-eyed woman lookin' a mile ahead
thinking about broken bones [chorus]
it's her love that i want
it's her love that i need
it's her love got to have
it's her love heavenly body flying across the sky
superman was out of town
come on honey gotta change your tune
cause it's a long way down
clark kent looking for a free ride
thinking about lois lane
it's a bird it's a plane it's a suicide
and that'd be a shame [chorus] long arm looking for a fingerprint
trying to find the mystery clue
hitting me with the third degree
working on a thumb screw
alright officer i confess
everything's coming back
i didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
it was a heart attack [chorus] what's next to the moon? 	

 she was a danger
ain't no stranger
you give me rock 'n' roll around the town
just foolin' around
she's gonna break ya
wanna make ya
gonna make it
wanna take it down
she's gonna rock 'n' roll 'n' slide it down wheels
spinnin' around my brain driving you insane
wheels
rolling 'round my head going through the red she wanna shake you no way to save you
she's got me shot i'm fallin'
i'm blowin' it out
know what i'm talkin' about
she's gonna ride you wanna slide you
ain't no fakin' she wanna take you out
you betcha right she's gonna spin you 'round [repeat: x2]
wheels
spinnin' around my brain driving you insane
wheels
rolling 'round my head going through the red
wheels
flyin' down the road ready to explode
wheels
burnin' down the road hitting overload
